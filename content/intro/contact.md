## On feedback
I love feedback: +ve or -ve. I am serious about it: I have a special folder for compliments and critiques (though I tend to then consciously reject the former in accordance with father manu - "सम्मानाद्ब्राह्मणो नित्य- मुद्विजेत विषादिव । अमृतस्येव चाकाङ्क्षेद् अवमानस्य सर्वदा ॥"). So, don't hesitate!

## Emergency info
For use in case of emergencies:

- Do not resuscitate.
- Contact family and remind them of my death/ disability plan.
- If dead:
  - Donate eyes and any viable organs.
  - Donate body to medical school for dissection training. If that is not possible, incinerate.


## The name
'vAsuki' is not a 'family name'; it is a [patronymic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic) which comes from the name of my father: ವಾಸುಕಿ ಕಡಬ ರಙ್ಗರಾಜ ಅಯ್ಯಙ್ಗಾರ್. (My "family name" would actually be 'अय्यङ्गार्'.) So, I prefer to be called: vishvAs. (Note that I use [OPTITRANS](https://sanskrit-coders.github.io/input/optitrans/) to encode hindu sounds in latin alphabet.)

## Language

I like to practice my sometimes questionable language skills (संस्कृत-भाषा, ಕನ್ನಡ, हिन्दी, ಹೆಬ್ಬಾರ್ ತಮಿಳ್) on others. I try to speak Indian languages with Indians (an aptly moderated "न वदेद् यावनीं भाषां प्राणैः कण्ठगतैर् अपि"). Incidentally, you can practice conversational संस्कृत-भाषा in many places around the world, including [Austin](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgroup.php%3Fgid%3D258123070220&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGJI0Gi3I5wndPIaMKZjAVvlRJUAw) and the SF Bay area), thanks to [संस्कृत-भारती](http://samskritabharati.org)!
