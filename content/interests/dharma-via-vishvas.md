title: Dharma Via Vishvas
---

PS: In case you're wondering - the below sponsorship invitation has mostly been futile, and we've relied on family funds. (Details- [dyuganga](http://sanskrit.github.io/groups/dyuganga/) org page.)

## Intro
Donate to _Dharma via Vishvas_ if you:

- like his creations and endeavors (described below), to which he is incidentally dedicated **full-time**
- trust him to honestly use all money received here towards dharma.
- either agree with his worldview, or acknowledge to yourself that it differs from yours.

PS: Vishvas is an individual - donations made via him are not tax-deductible.

### Sponsor what?
Briefly, sponsorship will support **open source** (sanskrit/ jyotisha etc..) software, book digitization/ presentation, audio recording/ presentation, dictionary, text commentary projects. 

Sponsorship will help with these **open source** projects:

- Free open source software - See various repos under orgs such as [sanskrit-programmers](https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/), [jyotisha](https://github.com/jyotiSham/), [indic-dict](https://github.com/indic-dict/) etc. (Full list under github [profile](github.com/vvasuki/)).
- Book digitizations. Examples - 
  - [saMskAraratnamAlA](https://vishvAsa.github.io/vedAH/taittirIyam/sUtram/hiraNyakeshI/paddhatiH/saMskAraratnamAlA/), an excellent KYV paddhati text especially popular in mahArAShTra (albeit belonging to the closely related hiraNyakeshI sUtra). This was executed by saMskRtabhAratI people (at their expense) after I suggested the text to them.
  - SC Vasu's English commentary on aShTAdhyAyI ( example [here](https://ashtadhyayi.github.io/sutra-details/?sutra=1.1.6) ), sponsored by shrI nIlesh of [ashyadhyayi.com](http://ashyadhyayi.com) .
- Publishing and distributing useful dictionaries - See repos under [indic-dict](https://github.com/indic-dict) for example.
- Producing audio books and recordings - See [here](https://sanskrit.github.io/groups/dyuganga/projects/audio/) for example. 
- Presentation of corrected, flowing text with audio tracks. The text will (just like our audio files) be made available for free in markdown format - anyone can copy and reuse. Examples of such text with audio presentations:
    - [rAmAyaNa](https://vishvAsa.github.io/purANam/rAmAyaNam/) 
    - [raghuvaMsha](https://vishvAsa.github.io/kAvyam/laxyam/padyam/kAlidAsaH/raghuvaMsham/sarva-prastutiH//) 
    - [kumArasambhava](https://vishvAsa.github.io/kAvyam/laxyam/padyam/kAlidAsaH/kumArasambhavam/) 
    - [durgA saptashatI](https://vishvAsa.github.io/purANam/durgA-saptashatI/01-prathama-charitam/)
    - [rAmacharitamAnasa](https://vishvAsa.github.io/kAvyam/laxyam/padyam/purANam/rAmacharitamAnasa-TIkA/02_ayodhyAkANDa/)
    - [nArAyaNIyam](https://vishvAsa.github.io/kAvyam/laxyam/padyam/purANam/nArAyaNIyam/003/)
    - several sAmans etc.. 
- Original, easy to follow, commentary on (mostly sanskrit) classical texts. Examples: 
  - Apastamba [gRhya](https://vishvAsa.github.io/vedAH/taittirIyam/sUtram/ApastambaH/gRhyam/) and [dharma](https://vishvAsa.github.io/vedAH/taittirIyam/sUtram/ApastambaH/dharma-sUtram/) sUtra-s
  - The [first prapAThaka of first kANDa of kRShNa yajurveda](https://vishvAsa.github.io/vedAH/taittirIyam/saMhitA/1/1/) 

### Execution
- I do much of the work myself. I also take (well-)paid support from other learned people via the [dyuganga](http://sanskrit.github.io/groups/dyuganga/) team.
