The monograph brought out the selfish gene, altruistic organism concept very well. In your explanation of the tit-for-tat and bourgeois strategies which have been so successful among living organisms, I found a gentle introduction to game theory. I was also surprised by thjis suggestion that wasps are intelligent enough to recognize other specific individuals, and to play politics. I especially liked the fact that you provided simple arithmetic to solidly support your points. Though the focus is on animal societies, I think your book should also have mentioned some other things like the importance of random variation in phenotypic expression (eg number of eyes in Drosophila flies). Besides being crisp and well written, it is also quite cheap and small in size. I have also had the privilege of recommending this book to my friends in the lay public (some of who try to elevate humans from animals) as an introduction into the evolutionary basis of cooperation and conflict in society.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Never boring. Mostly not venturing to say that which need not be said. I wouldn't have thought that the seemingly quiet and introverted Japanese could be so expressive in speech. It was like travelling to an alien land and gaining a wildly different perspective.<br/><br/>The personalities there are fascinating-<br/>- of course, Kafka Tamura himself, his curse, his tortured yet collected mental state; the boy named crow.<br/>- the boring irresponsible Hashino who becomes more emotionally responsible and an aesthete after meeting the intuitive Mr Nakata; his impressions about the police and his past girls<br/>- The odd Oshima, his brother, Sakura, Miss Saeki who help the runaway Kafka Tamura despite dubious circumstances - folks who go by feeling as much as by thought<br/>- The bold Oshima, with her broken yet functional body, who cares deeply for those she deems deserving while casually not caring for the rest<br/>- The strangers who help Mr Nakata on his way, the gangsters who antagonize him<br/>- the perfect couple Miss Saeki and Mr Omura<br/>- the regretless cat-soul harvester who follows his rules, cannot stop himself, is sick of doing what he does.<br/>- the coffee shop owner who explains those two classical music pieces to his patron<br/>- the kind and perceptive school teacher whose surreal dream, unwitting violence and lies form the background of Mr Nakata<br/>- even Mr Nakata's uncaring siblings, his employer, the cousin that squandered his money, the governer and his subsidy. <br/><br/>The way these personalities are realized - with their quirks - is also wonderful:<br/>- Nakata's strange way of speaking - avoiding the first person, sleeping for days on end, infinite patience, ability to wait days on end, careful grooming, frequent self-deprecation and politeness.<br/>- Hoshino's fondness for polo shirts, dragons fan hat<br/>- Kafka's gym and non-gym exercise routines<br/><br/>Then there are those wonderful concepts:<br/>- frequently experiencing the world as if one were reading metaphors into them - for example memory in a well maintained library, the labyrinth of one's mind in a confusing forest, a sister in a sisterly friend.<br/><br/>The situations themselves -<br/>- planning behind running away, identifying a run-away and school-refuser<br/>- the vivid dreams<br/>- the living spirit <br/>- the crooked curse which runs its course torturing Kafka along the way<br/>- the final peace and closure that they all experience - Kafka, Miss Saeki, Hashino, Nagata<br/>- the entrence stone, the concept clothed as Col Sanders<br/>- life in the other world<br/>- the concerns of cats<br/>- the jumbling of proper event order due to magical imbalance<br/>- the lost love, reincarnation, abandonment, its cause and final healing<br/>- the many notes on philosophy, the personalities of composers, the special notes in musical pieces and their performance.<br/>- the micro-level dharma - being grateful, living without regrets, making amends, helping others, thoroughly and routinely cleaning up cabins and rooms while vacating.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

That's the good part. He does this while not getting tripped up over the low care on civilian lives on the part of the Mongols.<br/><br/>He also brings out the poignancy of the fall of this great empire and its ruling clan - कालय तस्मै नमः।.<br/><br/>The bad part is that he goes way overboard in attributing every great innovation (postal system, meritocracy, secularism, postal system, efficient global commerce) to the Mongol empire. Further, his monotheist (and pro-secularist) bias (culminating in misrepresentation) is shockingly clear to any polytheist at places (that mongols adored one great blue sky god). In one place, his mongolophilia turns into Islamophilia (pertaining to the mughal rule in India), which is quite irritating for Hindus (this is one of other such points). So, perhaps naturally given his background, he doesn't quite carefully distinguish the mongol system and its fair-mindedness from Abrahamist memetic diseases to which it ultimately succumbed. <br/>Also, the choice of the cover picture is atrocious.<br/><br/>Yet to check out his music recommendations - Altai Hangai, Black Horse, Black Rose, Khonkh, Tenger Ayalguu, Tumen Ekh, N Jantasannorov, Purevkhuu + Ariunaa.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
