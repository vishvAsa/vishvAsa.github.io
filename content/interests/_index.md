title: +Interests
---

- I have pursued far too many interests to list here (snowboarding, hiking, music, films, web surfing, karate, dog walking, travelling, mysticism (Damn that memory!), personal finance).
- However, I seem to pursue only a few at any given point in time. At the time of this writing, my major intersts were parenting, homeschooling, running a dhArmika household, Sanskrit kAvya and shAstra-s, classic literature, nice podcasts, music, films, web surfing, hindu affairs, computer programming to aid such pursuits.
- I practice yoga daily. I also enjoy the precise, musical art of chanting the vedas - atleast the bits familiar to me, and I enjoy performing various nitya and naimittika karmas. Are body, breath, intellect, desires and sound not intimately connected? Is humble but uncompromising devotion to the truth and purity not good?

## Miscellenia:

- Charities I favor:
  - [Ekal-vidyAlaya](http://www.ekal.org/): education (rooted in the dharma) of tribal children, for as low as $1 per day per school.
