## Spaceship earth
- In a world(s?) of limited resources, we, and our "civilization" will grind to a halt, likely on this very "Spaceship Earth" - sooner or later, gracefully or otherwise based on whether wisdom is in charge. The wise amongst us may not have much chance, but while we're around, may our consciousness expand to the limits reachable.

## agrahAra sought
A more rural lifestyle is more sustainable (especially considering the inevitable oil/metal... exhaustion) - https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9js5291m . Currently, returning to the village is not practical for me (family interests can't be satisfied), but would be very interested in atleast offering a good option to my progeny. The brief flash of life and prajNA on this planet should last as long and as strongly as possible - so, atleast some people should strive to be non-short-sighted, and think in timelines spanning centuries or millennia.

Rather than reinventing the wheel, I'd like to depend on what's tried and tested - which would fit both our temperaments and the community - so if anyone knows of thriving agrahAra-s (which have not turned into old age homes or worse abandoned to inimical systems), please let me know.
