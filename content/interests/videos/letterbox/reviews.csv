Thereafter, most of the patients at the Institute ask to be taken by K-PAX on his journey back home. Powell decides to subject prot to regression hypnosis, which works well. Using information gained from these sessions, Powell figures out that prot may simply be an alter ego of Robert Porter, a man from New Mexico whose life had been devastated by the murder of his wife and child in 1996.On July 27 as the hospital staff watch, the camera in Porter/prot's room cuts to static at the precise time prot said he would leave Earth. Powell finds Porter lying on the floor in his room, catatonic, prot having apparently left Porter's body for the light travel back to K-PAX. The final scene's voiceover is prot explaining to Powell that the people of K-PAX have discovered that our universe will repeat its events again and again, so the mistakes we make will be repeated forever, and prot encourages Powell to make this time count as it is the only chance we have.

Story 1: A shipwreck leaves a Indian (hindu/ all religions are ok) boy (son of a rationalist father and veg spiritual mother), a tiger, a zebra with a broken leg, an orangutan, hyena on a life-boat. Hyena kills zebra for food, tries to kill the boy, later the Orangutan (distressing the boy). Tiger kills the hyena, eats leftovers of everything. Boy escapes and survives in self-made raft tied to boat, lives on rations, becomes non-veg, catches fish feeds tiger, rescues tiger from the sea when it jumps in sea to get to him. Tames tiger _eventually_. Sees beauty (bioluminiscence, clear water and skies, flying fish), fierce power and awe of strum and dang. Gets respite on a mangrove which turns deadly at night, reaches mexico. Story 2: hyena: cruel but practical cook (makes raft to catch fish etc..). zebra with broken leg: sailor killed for bait. orangutan = boy's mother - accidentally killed by cook when arguing with hyena to leave boy alone. boy kills cook in rage (cook doesn't resist) - saddened to have been turned to a beast, but uses his carcass for bait. (deadly but respiteful island - represents some psychological state?) Stupendous climax despite hard-to-stand (for those like me) start. Rich in visual beauty. Reaffirms the role of religous myth in understanding nature, human nature and hope (after abstracting away gory bloody lesser facts by allegory). The hero, that crafted such a deep, imaginatively rich allegory, HAD to be a hindu. Few other (extant, major) cultures can easily produce an equivalent.",,2021-01-14

The plan goes awry when the Dude's friend Walter Sobchak schemes to keep the full ransom. Turns out, there was no kidnapping - merely German nihilist amateurs taking advantage of the wife's trip; that the millionaire did not really send a ransom - merely used opportunity to embezzle funds, that the millionaire is not as successful as he claimed - living on an allowance allowed by his daugher and fellow board member. The trophy wife is a former porn artist in debt to porn film maker. Wonderful character portraits: The dude is very cool, relaxed, unemployed, hence smart and able to figure everything out. Walter Sobchak, vietnam vet, is very uptight about ""rules"" being followed, the Jewish religion he adapted when he married a wife (whom he still cares for) he divorced 5 years ago.

The actors include an acrobat couple with an infant - cheerful, the male being able to see visions. Along the way, Christian society is depicted, with its gruesome beliefs (hell after death) and practices (death cult zealots lashing each other, dragging crosses, burning people at the stake etc..)

Movie is mostly about how different people react to and face death. The knight isnt sure that God or life after death exists; but desperately tries to know (unsuccessfully); seeks to do some meaningful thing. The squire is lively and defiant - only submits to death with a protest. The acrobat couple give it a good pass like ordinary cheerful family people. A jester tries to escape death but fails.
