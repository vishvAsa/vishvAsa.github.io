Why are you here? Probably for one of the following reasons:

- You just want to check me and my interests out.
  - If so, welcome - click around.
- You're interested in me as a contributor to sanskrit learning and processing.
  - Oh, you're more likely to be in luck. Look around. But you'll probably not find my best work here. Instead head over to [github](https://github.com/vvasuki) (especially the coder organizations I participate in) and the mailing lists. And checkout [dyugangA](https://sanskrit.github.io/groups/dyuganga/).
- You're interested in my views on certain topics. If so -
  - There will be loads of public notes (with books and articles I've gathered/ annotated) at multiple sites such as [Agama](AgamaH/) and [notes](notes/) sites (use the sidebar/ topbar to navigate).
  - My most valuable thoughts, which I hope will survive beyond my body's demise, especially in my progeny 
    - [२१-तम-शतक-पदार्थ-शास्त्र-परिष्कारः](/AgamaH/AryaH/hinduism/branches/nyAya-vaisheShike/21ce-padArtha-shAstra-pariShkAraH/)
    - [भार्गवाग्निः](/kAvyam/laxyam/padyam/vishvAsaH/saMyamaH/bhArgava-mantraH)
  - In some sensitive cases (rituals, politics, etc..) you'll be disappointed and not find what you seek in this public place. Rest assured: My most frankest observations remain hidden. As they say: अतिपरिचयात् अवज्ञा। So, try not to form rather strong opinions based on this allegedly "personal" web page - this interaction is not satisfactorily deep!
- You're interested in me as a computer programmer or researcher.
  - If so, yes I am an engineer. I worked in some fancy corporations of my time, and graduated from the Computer Science department of the University of Texas at Austin with an MS in Computer Science. I keep engineering software for the sanskrit community and my text/ audio curation needs. You'll find my CV and details somewhere on this site.

Like most people, I have dreams and a non-insignificant potential for good. 

<details><summary>Pretentious intro</summary>

A pretentious intro I wrote for myself in the third person for some lecture:

Vishvāsa, son of Vāsuki, is a practicing Hindu, a lover of both hard rationality and tender aesthetic sensitivity. He is content following the three life-values (puruṣartha-s), cognizant of his gratitude towards the deva-s, sages, his ancestors, society and nature at large. He spends much of his free time learning, propagating and adding to saṃskṛta shāstra-s and kāvya-s. He also follows and occassionally debates on a wide variety of issues affecting the Hindu ethos and humanity in general. He speaks Saṃskṛtam, Kannaḍa, Hindī, Hebbār Tamiḷ and English - in roughly that order of preference. Originally from southern Karnāṭaka, his body is borne by the ??? area. He was a professional computer programmer, and has sampled academic research - and occasionally utilizes those skills for his projects. Other interests include snowboarding, music, films, hiking, web surfing etc.. He organizes some of his thoughts at [vishvAsa.github.io](http://vishvAsa.github.io) and welcomes comments and criticism.
