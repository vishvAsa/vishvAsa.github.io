Why are you here? Probably for one of the following reasons:

- You just want to check me and my interests out.
  - If so, welcome - click around.
- You're interested in me as a computer programmer or researcher.
  - If so, yes I am an engineer. I worked in some fancy corporations of my time, and graduated from the Computer Science department of the University of Texas at Austin with an MS in Computer Science. I keep engineering software for the sanskrit community. You'll find my CV and details somewhere on this site.
- You're interested in me as a contributor to sanskrit learning and processing.
  - Oh, you're more likely to be in luck. Look around. But you'll probably not find my best work here. Instead head over to [github](https://github.com/vvasuki) (especially the coder organizations I participate in) and the mailing lists. And checkout [dyugangA](https://sanskrit.github.io/groups/dyuganga/).
- You're interested in my views on certain topics.
  - If so, in some sensitive cases (rituals, politics, etc..) you'll be disappointed and not find what you seek in this public place. Though there will be loads of public notes at [saMskAra notes site](saMskAra/).
  - In other cases, you can visit my [notes site](notes/).

Like most people, I have dreams and a non-insignificant potential for good. Rest assured: My most frankest observations remain hidden. As they say: अतिपरिचयात् अवज्ञा। So, try not to form rather strong opinions based on this allegedly "personal" web page - this interaction is not satisfactorily deep!

### Pretentious summary

A pretentious intro I wrote for myself in the third person for some lecture:

- Vishvāsa, son of Vāsuki, is a practicing Hindu, a lover of both hard rationality and tender aesthetic sensitivity. He is content following the three life-values (puruṣartha-s), cognizant of his gratitude towards the deva-s, sages, his ancestors, society and nature at large. He spends much of his free time learning, composing and propagating saṃskṛta kāvya-s and shāstra-s. He also follows and occassionally debates some issues affecting the Hindu ethos and humanity in general. He speaks Saṃskṛtam, Kannaḍa, Hindī, Hebbār Tamiḷ and English - in roughly that order of preference. Originally from southern Karnāṭaka, his body is borne by the ??? area. He is a computer programmer by profession, and has sampled academic research in the past. Other interests include snowboarding, hiking, music, films, web surfing etc.. He organizes some of his thoughts at [vvasuki.github.io](http://vvasuki.github.io) and welcomes comments and criticism.
