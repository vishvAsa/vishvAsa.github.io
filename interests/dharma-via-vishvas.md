- like his creations and endeavors (Eg - inline comments for [mantras](https://vvasuki.github.io/saMskAra/mantra/soma/paravastu-saama/AdIShAdiyyam/), [shAstra](https://vvasuki.github.io/saMskAra/kalpa/sUtra/Apastamba/pramANAni/dharma-sUtra/pAtra/Ashrama/samAvRtta/)-s and [kAvyas](https://vvasuki.github.io/kAvya/TIkA/champU/nIti/panchatantra/mitrabheda/00-vardhamAnakathA/), open source software [code](https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/), [audio curation and recording projects](https://sanskrit.github.io/projects/) etc..), to which he is incidentally dedicated **full-time**
- agree with his worldview
- trust him to honestly use all money received here towards dharma.
