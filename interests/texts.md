## Intro

- With physical books, I like to mark (with a pencil):
    - words that are new to me (with meanings)
    - words and phrases that I find beautiful
    - grammatical flaws
    - printing mistakes that I correct
    - (In case of particularly difficult verses) - पद-endings (with vertical lines), their vibhakti-s (on top of word endings, numbered १-७, with additional markings as in _१'_ to distinguish words related to distinct objects terminating in the same vibhakti)
    - my scores for beauty for (nearly) each verse - 1/5 to 5/5.
        - Sometimes these marks prefixed with क (to indicate that beauty in plot twist is being measured), र (to indicate rasa-beauty etc..)


## Collections
- [kalpa and mantras](/notes/mantra/agni/divaspari.html) (and other notes in the same site.)
- [Books read](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Al_QBT-hoqqVdHMtUFljMTRVQzBxSlRBb1M4dDBQVnc&gid=1)
- [सुभाषितानि](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18HwdEp49UdRe1l4Lk2pM73xIs9ulBKyDE3BW32vMKyc/edit?usp=sharing)।

- Google play ebook notes (automatic backup in Drive): [bit.ly/vv-play-notes](http://bit.ly/vv-play-notes). (Advantages of ebooks [here](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOJQqymltNQMs7RHBz8rD2lWoa3EuEofzhzcYn5/photo/AF1QipPUr0S_cMva23_SAuLpR5J8CFc3kdOacKIn_Cu1).)
    - Note: Mistakes in the backup tend to occur more with books Google would need to OCR-ed (because they don't have digitized "flowing" text).
    - Example: [https://goo.gl/C9j3Vs](https://goo.gl/C9j3Vs).

    - I use a temperature scale for marking verses: 4/4= red 3/4=yellow 2/4=green 1/4=blue (since there are only 4 highlighting colors in google play).
